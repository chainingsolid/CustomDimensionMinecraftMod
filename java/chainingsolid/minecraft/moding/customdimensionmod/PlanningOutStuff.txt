Planning out stuff
	
	"spread region" = a set of "influence nodes"(on a grid) that spread out from a central one randomly, and get weeker as they go out, and winners in over laps are solved by whos stronger
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	Stages
		
		1) gen transport "spread regions"
			water, land and both(water and land transport)
			1.1 gen the regions
			1.2 insure all land and all water is connected
				done by pathing between "spread regions" of the same type with slight priorty given to pathing thru the same region type
			1.2.1 water paths to water and "both" with rivers
				land paths to land and both with "both"
			
		2) gen terrain types
			2.1 gen terrain "spread regions"
				the starter node's terrain type is based on the type of transport region its on
			
		3) gen biome/foilage types
			3.1 gen foilage "spread regions"
				also based on the starter node's terrain type
		
		4) gen over view cave maps
			4.1 gen cave regions
			4.2 do the connect regions by pathing between them trick
		
		5) gen over view path map
			5.1 place points randomly on the map and path between em'
				master path points always path to any close master points (insures connectivty)
				lesser points always path to a master point, and path randomly to any other points
		
		6) plan structure locations
			6.1 pick a structure based on terrain type foilage type and maybe some other stuff
			6.2 do what ever other planning the picked sturcture requires
		
		7) end planning phaze
			
			
		8) gen terrain
			
		9) gen caves
			
		10) gen stuctures
			
		11) gen paths
			
		12) gen foilage
